= Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) =

As an extension to the Nodal Analysis, CHuNG-WEN HO, ALBERT E. RUEHLI AND PIERCE A. BRENNAN,
described their modified nodal analysis (MNA) method in their 1975 paper.

The addition allows to create a matrix in linear time by iterating over the lines of a 
textual description of a circuit. That matrix lends itself to equation solving algorithms.
That means MNA allows the computation of any circuit by a computer which was not possible with
standard nodal analysis.

== Groups ==
Before solving the linear equations, the equations have to be determined from the textual circuit 
description. The equations are read from the MNA matrix. The MNA matrix has to be construted first,
in linear time by reading the circuit description.

To construct the MNA matrix, so called stamps are used.
stamps are templates that prescribe which numbers to add into the elements of the MNA matrix
for each lumped element in the circuit.

Every lumped element has either one or two stamps of which exactly one is applied to the MNA matrix.

If a lumped element has only a single stamp, that stamp is used for the element always.

If a lumped element has two stamps, one of those stamps is choosen based on it's membership in 
the groups. There are exactly two groups.
When the element is in group 1, it's group 1 template is used.
When the element is in group 2, it's group 2 template is used.

That means, that during construction of the MNA matrix, the computer has to first determine
if a lumped element in the circuit description belongs to group 1 or group 2. It then has to
apply the correct stamp to build the matrix.

group 1 elements are described as (see page.33 [2]);
"Deﬁnition 2.6. (Element Groups) All elements whose currents are to be elimi-
nated will be referred to as being in group 1 ..."

group 2 elements are described as (see page.33 [2]);
"..., while all other elements will be referred to as group 2."





This definition does not allow for a programmer to implement the decision making in code.

So a better definition of group 1 for implementars is given in (see page.33 [2])

"Recall, the elements in group 1 must be either resistors, independent current
sources, VCCS, or CCCS."

And a better definition of group 2 is given in (see page.33 [2])
"keeping in mind that the controlling element for the CCCS is in group 2"

That means that for an element to go into group 1
- the element is any type of Current Source, be it Independant, Voltage- or Current Controlled Current Sources
- the element is a resistor that is not in group 2

That means that for an element to go into group 2
- the element is a resistor of which the current over the resistor is used as a control 
  variable for Current sources
- the element is not in group 1





== Voltage and Current entries in the MNA matrix ==

For all elements in group 1, there will be a voltage entry in the MNA matrix. (Current Source -> Voltage equation)
For all elements in group 2, there will be a current entry in the MNA matrix. (Voltage Source -> Current equation)

This can be derived by observing the excercise 2.10 in [2] 






== Dimensions of the MNA Matrix =

To find the dimension of the MNA matrix, first build the so-called "v i" - vector (short vi)

vi is constructed with elements for all voltages and the elements for all currents appended to that.

Example:
If there are two voltages (v1 and v2) and to currents (i1 and i2) then vi looks like [v1 v2 i1 i2]T (T for transposed).
The MNA matrix is then veT x ve, that means the MNA matrix is constructed from the 16 elements using the 
columns v1 v2 i1 i2 as in viT and the rows v1, v2, i1, i2 as in vi

How many v and i are there in the ie vector?
For every element in group1, add a voltage element
For every element in group2, add a current element

So, if your circuit has n lumped elements, you will get a n x n MNA matrix.
group 1 and group 2 form a partition over all elements in the circuit so 
the amount of elements in group 1 added with the amount of elements in group 2 will add up to n.
You will have size(group 1) voltage equations
You will have size(group 2) current equations





== Excercise 2.10 in [2] ==
Algorithm:
1. Count rows in the circuit description == amount of lumped elements == dimension of MNA matrix
2. Add elements to groups:
   - IVS -> group 2
   - ICS -> group 1
   - Resistor dependent on group tag in circuit description, either group 1 or group 2 if G2 tag is present
3. Build stamps for each lumped element. Watch reference node 0 and collapse stamps accordingly
4. Add stamps into the MNA matrix and RHS
5. Output the result.






== Stamps ==




=== Resistors (R) ===

Resistors have two stamps:

Stamp for group 1:

		v+		v-		RHS
--------------------------------
v+		1/R		-1/R
v-		-1/R	1/R

Stamp for group 2:

		v+		v-		i		RHS
----------------------------------------
v+						+1
v-						-1
i		+1		-1		-R


Collapsing:
Stamps for group 1 resistors can collapse if the resistor is connected
to the refernce node (0V) with one of it's terminals. The stamp then consist of only a single element:

Let R be connected to a voltage v_2 using it's v+ terminal and to ground/reference with it's v- terminal
Let R be a 1 ohm resistor
Let R be a group 1 resistor

The stamp originally is:

		v+		v-		RHS
--------------------------------
v+		1/R		-1/R
v-		-1/R	1/R

Because of the reference connection to ground / reference, it collapse to

		v_2		RHS
------------------------
v_2 	1

Collapsing means, rows and columns of the terminals connected to ground / refernces are just ignored / removed
from the stamp, or not added to the MNA matrix when that stamp is applied.





== Independant Current Sources (ICS) ==

ICS have two stamps:

Stamp for group 1:

		v+		v-		RHS
---------------------------------
v+						-I
v-						+I

Stamp for group 2:

		v+		v-		i		RHS
----------------------------------------
v+						+1
v-						-1
i						+1		I

== Independant Voltage Source (IVS) ==

Has only a single stamp:

		v+		v-		i		RHS
----------------------------------------
v+						+1
v-						-1
i		+1		-1				V

== Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS) ==

Has only a single stamp

		v+		v-		v_x+		v_x-		i		RHS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
v+												+1
v-												-1
i		+1		-1		-k			+k

== Current Controlled Voltage Source (CCVS) ==

Has only a single timestamp

		v+		v-		i_s			i_x			RHS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
v+						+1						
v-						-1						
i_s		+1		-1					-k
i_x
